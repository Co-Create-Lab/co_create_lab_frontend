                We’re a community of people who want to work together on cool ideas.{" "}
                Our focus is on web and mobile apps, but we also have a lot of fun
                with games and other projects. We are all about making cool things
                with technology – no matter if you are an experienced developer or
                if you are just starting out.

          In our free time we organize workshops and training sessions in
            various technical topics like frontend development, fullstack
            development, UX design, design thinking, etc. In the end of every
            workshop we discuss what worked well during the workshop and where
            new topics could be developed in the future. We love to organize
            events where people from all over the world can meet each other and
            enjoy themselves while they learn something new.
